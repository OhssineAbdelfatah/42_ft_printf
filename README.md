## ft_printf: Your Custom printf Function

**Tired of the limitations of standard printf?** 

This project empowers you to create your very own `ft_printf` function, replicating the functionality of the classic `printf` while potentially adding your own unique features! 

### Take Control of Formatting

Embrace the power to format output exactly how you desire! This project focuses on implementing essential format specifiers like:

* `%d`: Print integers
* `%s`: Print strings
* `%c`: Print characters
* `%p`: Print pointers
* (and potentially more!)

### Mastering ft_printf

This project serves as a stepping stone towards mastering formatted output. By implementing `ft_printf` yourself, you'll gain a deeper understanding of:

* Variable arguments
* Format string parsing
* Conditional printing based on format specifiers
* Memory manipulation (for handling strings and pointers)

### Getting Started

**Ready to unleash your inner printf pro?**

1. **Clone the repository:**

Utilisez ce code avec pr√©caution.

git clone https://<your_github_username>@github.com/<your_username>/ft_printf.git


2. **Compile the project:**

make


3. **Link the library (if using in another project):**

   - Specify the path to the compiled library (`libftprintf.a`) during compilation of your main project.

### Usage

**Crafting your formatted output:**

Use `ft_printf` just like the standard `printf`:

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main() {
  int num = 42;
  char str[] = "Hello, world!";

  ft_printf("The answer is %d\n", num);
  ft_printf("The greeting is %s\n", str);

  return 0;
}
```
This code will print:

```bash
The answer is 42
The greeting is Hello, world!
```
Bonus Round (Optional)

This project can be extended to implement additional functionalities not found in standard printf, pushing your formatting skills even further!
